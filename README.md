# HTNPLanValidationThesis
In this readme link is provided to the code for a plan verification algorithm inspired by parsing. This algorithm was implemented by Simona Ondrčková and presented in her master thesis: https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/116612?locale-attribute=en

The hierarchical plan verification code for parsing based verifier can be found here in the Plan Validation folder: https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/116612/120352460.zip?sequence=4&isAllowed=y The link also contains a Plan Recognition folder which contains the code for a plan recognition algorithm. More information on how it works can be found in the thesis. 

Note that this is an older version of the code and there have since been new articles published. Below are some exmaples:
Roman Barták et al. A Novel Parsing-based Approach for Verification of Hierarchical Plans published in ICTAI 2020 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9288328

Roman Barták et al. On the Verification of Totally-Ordered HTN Plans published in ICTAI 2021 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9643240

Simona Ondrčková et al. On Heuristics for Parsing-based Verification of Hierarchical Plans with a Goal Task published in FLAIRS 2022 https://journals.flvc.org/FLAIRS/article/view/130606

New github file with the final version of the code  (which will encompass all the newer versions) will be created in the future.
