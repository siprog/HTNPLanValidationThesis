# HTNPLanValidationThesis
In this readme I will provide a link to the code for a plan verification algorithm inspired by parsing. This algorithm was implemented by Simona Ondrčková and presented in her master thesis: https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/116612?locale-attribute=en

The hierarchical plan verification code for parsing based verifier can be found here in the Plan Validation file: https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/116612/120352460.zip?sequence=4&isAllowed=y 

The link also contains a Plan reocgnition folder which contains the code for a plan recognition algorithm. More information on how it work s can be found in the thesis. 

Note that this is an older version of the code and there have since been new articles describing newer versions (for example):

Roman Barták et al. On the Verification of Totally-Ordered HTN Plans published in ICTAI 2021 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9643240

Simona Ondrčková et al. On Heuristics for Parsing-based Verification of Hierarchical Plans with a Goal Task published in FLAIRS 2022 https://journals.flvc.org/FLAIRS/article/view/130606



We plan to create a new github file with the final version of the code  (which will encompass all the newer versions) in the future.
