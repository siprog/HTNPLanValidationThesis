# HTNPLanValidationThesis
HTN Plan Validation code from a master thesis.
In this readme I will provide a link to the code for a plan verification algorithm inspired by parsing. This algorithm was implemented by Simona Ondrčková and presented in her master thesis: https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/116612?locale-attribute=en
The hierarchical plan verification code for parsing based verifier can be found here in the Plan Validation file: https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/116612/120352460.zip?sequence=4&isAllowed=y 
Note that is an older version of the code and there have since been new articles describing newer versions:
On the Verification of Totally-Ordered HTN Plans published in ICTAI 2021 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9643240
On Heuristics for Parsing-based Verification of Hierarchical Plans with a Goal Task publsihed in FLAIRS 2022 https://journals.flvc.org/FLAIRS/article/view/130606

We plan to create a new github file with the final version of the code  (which will encompass all the newer versions) in the future.
